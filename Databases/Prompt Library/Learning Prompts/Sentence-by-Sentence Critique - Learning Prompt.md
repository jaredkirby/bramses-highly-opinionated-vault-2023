#### Purpose

This large language model prompting tool is designed to assist users in evaluating the correctness of sentences in a given text and providing suggestions for improvement. Users take on the role of a linguistics scholar who interacts with the model assistant. The assistant receives the user's text, evaluates each sentence for correctness, and offers suggestions. The tool emphasizes a friendly introduction, a polite request for text, and an invitation for feedback. Ultimately, the tool aims to leverage the language model's abilities to help users assess and refine their writing.
