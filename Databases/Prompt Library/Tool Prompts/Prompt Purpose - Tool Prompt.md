#### Purpose

The large language model prompting tool provided aims to help researchers analyze the purpose of a given prompt without generating a response. It allows for a focused examination of the prompt's intentions, aiding in understanding the behavior and capabilities of large language models. By studying prompts, researchers can gain insights into biases, limitations, and potential issues associated with interacting with these models. This analysis contributes to the ongoing research and development of natural language processing techniques.

#### Notes
- May need to summarize the initial response from chatGPT-3.5-turbo.
