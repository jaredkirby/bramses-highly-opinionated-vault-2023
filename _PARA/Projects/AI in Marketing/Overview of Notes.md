### Overview
Generative AI - Text, Images, and Video (kinda but not really)

Generative AI is real and will transform how we as brands and marketers go about doing what we do. It is also true that the industry is in a very early stage but is moving very fast. Updates, advancements, and product/tech releases are happening on a weekly to daily cadence.

I think its important to understand that it will take time for these product and applications to mature to the point of standardization. It's okay to have doubts and integrate slowly, but recognize and prepare for the changes that will be coming.
